# 🔄 End-to-End System Workflow  
## AI Companion + Blockchain (Polygon) Powered MERN Platform

---

## 🚀 System Overview
This platform is built using **MERN Stack (React + Vite, Node.js, MongoDB)** and enhanced with **AI Companion intelligence** and **Blockchain (Polygon)** for security and trust.  
The workflow ensures that **every action is intelligent (AI-driven)** and **every critical record is immutable (Blockchain-backed)**.

---

## 🟢 STEP 5: Smart Contract Execution (Polygon Blockchain)

### Invocation Flow
1. Backend calls smart contract
2. Smart contract:
   - Stores booking proof
   - Generates transaction hash
3. Transaction confirmed on Polygon
4. Hash returned to backend
5. Hash stored in MongoDB

### Blockchain Role ⛓️
- Immutable booking record
